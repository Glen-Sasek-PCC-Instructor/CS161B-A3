Tasklist for getting a grade A:
The below set of tasks, if completed correctly per the rubric will get you a grade of Exceeds and help master the concepts required to learn the objectives for this week’s topic. You can improve your grade by resubmitting the assignment once.
Before you get started:
Check out Sample Assignment A03 - Algorithmic Design document
Check out Sample Assignment A03 - SampleA03.cpp
Your job is to design and create a program to calculate the letter grade based on a 
numerical score. 

You will first read the numerical scores from the user as input into a double array, 
and then 
calculate the letter grade and fill another parallel array 
and 
print the two arrays as output. 
The numerical score must be between 0 and 4 inclusive. 
The user should not be allowed to enter a score less than 0 or greater than 4.

You will also sort the arrays based on the scores, 
and 
calculate the median of the scores 
and 
output the sorted arrays and the median in main().
Write the following functions and call them in the same order as instructed 
in the main() function to accomplish this Task.

void welcome() - This function prints a welcome message to the user.

void readScores(double scores[], int &count)
Reads a list of scores from the user. A -1 indicates the end of the input and is not stored in the array. (Use an appropriate loop!! Check out this example code - a for loop is count controlled, and a while loop is condition based.) 
Call the readDouble function to do this.
You must catch all invalid data such as characters, negative numbers other than -1 etc.
The variable count keeps track of the number of scores entered.
You must also do validation to make sure that the number is between 0 and 4 inclusive and nothing other than that. Use a while loop to do this.

void readDouble(string prompt, double &num)
This function should be used any time you read any floats or doubles from the user. Use this function to read the numerical scores from the user.
It takes a string prompt, outputs it, reads a number from the user, validates and returns the num by reference.
Write it exactly like the readInt from assignment 1 but declare a double or float instead of an int. See Samplea01.cpp for the readInt function.
You must catch all invalid data such as characters, negative numbers etc.

void calcGrade(double scores[], char grade[], int count)
Use a loop to process each array element and calculate the letter grade for each score.
Use the table below to assign grades A to F to the corresponding numerical score.

Letter Grade
4.0 Score
Level
A
>3.3  <= 4.0
Exceeds
B
>2.7 <= 3.3
Meets
C
>1.9 <= 2.7
Approaching
D
>1.1 <= 1.9
Not Yet
F
>0.0 <= 1.1
No Evidence


void printList(double scores[], char grades[], int count)
Go through a for loop and print the scores and the corresponding grades for each item.


void sort(double scores[], char grade[], int count)
Sort the arrays using the given sorting algorithm. This is called Selection Sort. Use only this algorithm to sort your list. To see how the Selection Card Sort Algorithm works, watch this video from Virginia Tech.
Be careful and make sure you sort based on the scores array and swap the corresponding element in the grade array to maintain the correspondence between the two arrays. Meaning if you swap the scores in index 0 and 5, you must also swap the corresponding grades in index 0 and 5.
Watch this Python Video to help you with the sorting algorithm. Try this Selection Sort Animation by Y. Daniel Liang.

procedure selection sort
   list  : array of items
   count : size of list
   for i = 0 to count - 1
   /* set current element as minimum*/
  	min = i    
  	/*go through the list and find the smallest element*/
  	for j = i+1 to count
     		if list[j] < list[min] then
        		min = j;
     		end if
  	end for
  	/* swap the minimum element with the current element
If they are not the same element*/
  	if min != i  then
     		swap list[min] and list[i]
  	end if
   end for
end procedure


double median(double scores[], int count)(***new to this level***)
After sorting, write this function to identify the median score. The median is located in the middle of the array if the array’s size is odd. Otherwise, the median is the average of the middle two values. 
Return the median to main() and output in main() with two decimal places.
int main()
Declare all variables needed. The 2 arrays (double scores[], and char grades[]) must be declared in main().
Call readScores() and send scores and count to it. This will fill the scores array from the user. You should call the readDouble() function to read and validate the scores before adding them to the scores array.
count will have the number of values read.
Call calcGrade()function that takes the scores array and an empty grades array and fills the grades array with letter grades.
Call the printList function to print the lists.
Call the sort function to sort the list based on scores.
Call the printList function to print the lists.
Call the median function to find the median and print it in main().
Assume the arrays will always contain fewer than 20 values. You must not let the user enter more than 20 values.
Open the Algorithmic Design Document, make a copy, and follow the steps to create your algorithm.
You must express your algorithm as pseudocode.
Check out all the coding constructs under Criteria for Success.
Criteria for Success
Use the below sample run as a guide to test your program.



Complete zyBooks sections 11.1 to 11.11 CS161B: Arrays, and zyLabs 11.15 and 11.16
Complete all sections of your Algorithmic Design Document.
You may use any IDE to write your code. If your Transfer University is PSU or plan to do more CS classes here at PCC, check out the Special Note For PSU Transfer section in the Syllabus.
Please bookmark the PCC Linux and Vim Manual - this will become a frequently used reference!
Include pseudocode in part d of the design document.
Follow these Coding Construct Requirements:
Your program must have function prototypes. Place the prototypes for your functions globally, after your #includes, just before main(). All functions must be implemented after main().
Each function must do only what it is supposed to do. For example, the menu function will simply display the menu, the readOption will take the option from the user, and so on.
You may not use a while true loop and break statements in the loop.
Your program must do all data validation mentioned in the functions.
Try not to have any redundant code (repeated code) in your program. That is the purpose of functions.
When you display the scores, it should be formatted appropriately with one decimal place.
Use constants where appropriate (for discount percentages).
Do not use arrays or any vectors for this program. Use only the concepts and functions we have learned so far.
Print a welcome and goodbye message.
Please open and compare your work with the grading rubric before submitting.
Remember to follow all style guidelines.
Download your Algorithmic Design Document as a PDF (File -> Download -> PDF), rename it to a03.pdf, and upload it to the D2L assignment by Wednesday.
Upload your a03.cpp C++ source file to the D2L assignment by Sunday.
Do your own work. Consult the syllabus for more information about academic integrity.
